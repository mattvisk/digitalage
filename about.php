<h1>Our Vision</h1>
  <p>
    Digitalage envisions a social media landscape that empowers individuals, enriches lives, and fosters authentic connections. One where creators prosper, communities thrive, and users regain control over their digital experiences. We are building that future.

  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    Digitalage was founded in 2021 by tech entrepreneurs and social media pioneers dedicated to positively disrupting the status quo. They witnessed first-hand the ways existing social platforms exploit users and creators to drive engagement over wellbeing. Digitalage rises from those learnings - and functions on an ethical foundation of transparency, equity and trust.
